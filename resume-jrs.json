    "summary": "I am a passionate developer who loves working with enthusiastic people on projects that matter. After graduating in Master Computer Engineering from the University of Bergamo (magna cum laude + gpa 4.0!), I started working as a contract researcher at the University of Bergamo. My work focuses on computer security, mostly investigating the integration of security features in (mobile|cloud|database) environments. My non-work interests range widely, from programming languages to machine learning. I love to solve problems, learn new things and discourse with interesting people.",
